Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

This is a branch of Computer science that takes the approach of developing,testing and deploying software that solve specific world problems and are of substantial quality.
It is important in the field of technology because:
Software engineering helps solve complex issues :this can be really time saving and effective especially when dealing with big projects.
Software engineering also is important in technology industry because it is a source of employment to many software engineers in different roles.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1.The development of High level languages.In the 1950s
Languages like cobal was created enabled programmers tocode in a language almost like human language.
2.Emergence of structured programming.1960s
Introduction of structured programming techniques like modularity and control flow.This promoted code reusability.
3.The object oriented paradigm.1970s-1980s
Here,development of object oriented like C++ and Java; introduced concepts like encapsulation,inheritance and polymorphism.Really bringing about improvement in code modularity and extensibility.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1.Requirement gathering and analysis-Involves gathering software requirements from the stakeholders.The stakeholders are customers ,end-users or business analyst based on this context.
2.Design- In this phase s/w design is created .
3.Implementation/Coding-the design is then implemented in code.
4.Testing-software is tested to ensure it meetsthe requirements and functions correctly.
5.Deployment-software is deployed to a production environment and made available to end-users.
Maintenance-includes on going support,bug fixing and updatesto the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall model is more of a sequential model that follows a series of outlined steps where by a phase has to be completed in order to go to the next.It is a possitive in scenarios where necessities are truly outlined and modifications wil not tend to arise while agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach .It brings about flexibility.It needs alot of collaboration and communication. It is a possitive for scenarios wherethere is room for flexibility and collaboration for it is very iterative ,it will need also good communication.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- mainly deals withdesigning,developing and testing the software.
Quality assurance engineer-mainly focuses testing and ensuring the quality of the software.
Project manager- oversees the entire project,including planning,monitoring and stakeholder management.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Improved agility-VCS and IDE integration allow developers to experiment and iterate quickly .
2. Code quality-IDEs help identify code errors early on , while VCS enables developers to track changesand revert to stable versions if needed.
3. Reduced riks of data loss- VCS serves as backup system,protecting against accidental code deletion or loss.
   Example of IDE:Visual studio
   Example of VCS:Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Broken SDLC process-overcome it by using engineering management platform
2.Lack of workflow visibility-invest in tools that help your team make decisions;project management tools,engineering management platforms like slack.
3.Developer burnout-invest in culture of learning and reward.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1.Unit testing-testing individual functions,methods,or modules in isolation.It catches errors early in development cycle.
2.Integration testing-testshow the components in system interact or co funtion with each other.Identifies interface errors and compatibility issues.
3.System testing-tests the entire system as a whole unit.It identifies perfomance,load,security and usability issues.
Acceptance testing-tests the software sytemfrom user perspective.Ensures that systemmeets business and user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

This is the design and science of crafting prompts in order to give desired response from AI models.
Importance
Creativity-prompts can stimulate the model's creativity.
Bias mitigation-it helps mitigate bias in AI models by crafting prompts that avoid discrimantory language or assumptions.
Communication enhancement-clear and concise prompts facilitate communication between users and models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
